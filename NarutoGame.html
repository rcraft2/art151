<h1>Naruto Run</h1>
<p>I produced this small game when I made my Naruto fan page for an assignment.
  I enjoy playing games, and have come to enjoy making them as well because I love
  making my work interactive. To play the game just use your mouse to click to jump
  over the incoming shurikens. Each jumped shuriken is worth 4 points, and your highscore
  for the session is saved.</p>
