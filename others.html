<p>This sketch was one of my favorites early on because it was a compicated one
  where I used a lot of my coding skills to pull off the timing for blinking and
  occasionally looking around.</p>

<p>This is another one of my animated projects that I did. It is a simple,
  window perspective of a kite flyinf in the wind as the clouds pass by.</p>

<p>This was one of my interactive pieces. It is a coloring book of sorts where the
  pen draws shapes at random. The color pallete is pastel, which is one of my favorite palletes, aesthetically.</p>
