<p>Some more about me:</p>
<p>For my aesthetic, I do not have a consistant style. However,
  I do prefer more modern and minimalistic, which this site potrays the best. My fan page
  had a more retro vibe to it, which I believed fit the setting of a fan page for anime much better
  than a modern approach. Another common theme that I have been able to bring out in my later projects
  is adding in interactivity, and games to my works. I want my work to be fun and enjoyable, and not just
  something you look at before moving on with your life. There are so many possibilities to video games,
  and I want to get better at making them more intricate with better mechanics, music, and graphics.</p>
